# ESP32-Potentiostat

This project aims to perform a cyclic voltametry on 3d printed potentiostat sensor. The op-amp circuit is used for producing neccessary triangular pulse or electrochemical processes. The overall circuit is connected to ESP32 for measuremnts to draw the Cyclic voltammetry curve.
The overall components are integrated into the PCB.

Note: This project is still being done...
